# Code Challenge + Words Translation

# How much time was invested
- Around 11 hours with breaks

# How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)
- As the time was not precisely tracked, only time precentages will be shared
- Time distribution: 
    - Concept: 30%
    - View: 5-10%
    - Model Layer: 5-10%
    - Game Mechanics: 50% - 60%

# Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game
- Most difficult issue was choosing how to approach correct & wrong pair random choosing. There was one approach using ids and current implementation.

# Decisions made because of restriced time
- Due to restriced time, UI was just scraped together, first idea was implemented with monochromantic color scheme and basic animations.
- Due to restricted time, only MVVM design pattern implemented without any creational or structurial patterns.

# What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time
- Displayed timer and message to user that there is one. 
- Start button for the user
- Launch image and app's icon
